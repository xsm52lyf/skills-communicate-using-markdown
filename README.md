## Step 5: Merge your pull request

_Great job adding a task list to the file :heart:_

You can now [merge](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) your pull request!

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge your pull request

```
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
```

#### How it looks

- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a task list

GitHub Actions went ahead and made a branch for you. So you'll need to add to the file we've created in the branch, and we will check your work as you work through this course!

1. Return to your pull request.
1. Use Markdown to create a task list. Here is an example:


# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest
# this is an new `<h1>` header,which add by xsm52lyf

## This is an `<h2>` header

###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest
###### this ia an `<h6>` header

<img alt="Image of Yaktocat" src=https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png width=400>


### :keyboard: Activity: Adding an image
```javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```

   ```md
   - [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
   - [ ] Outline my portfolio
   - [ ] Introduce myself to the world
   ```


   Remember, a task list starts with the syntax `- [ ]` and then the task list item. The formatting is specific!



1. As you did before, edit the file in this pull request.
1. In the file, add the correct Markdown for a code example of your choice.
1. Use the **Preview** tab to check your Markdown formatting.
1. Commit the changes to the file.
1. Click **Merge pull request**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
